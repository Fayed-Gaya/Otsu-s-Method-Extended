# Conversion to grayscale: The inputs to your program are color images. 
# First, convert the color images into grayscale using the formula 𝐼 = 𝑅ound(0.299𝑅 + 0.587𝐺 + 0.114𝐵) 
# where R, G and B are the pixel values from the red, green and blue  channels of the color images, respectively, and Round is the round off operator.
